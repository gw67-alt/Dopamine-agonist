A dopamine agonist from phenylethylamine: Dopamine Agonist Synthesis

Hydroxylation

Mix phenylethylamine with strong hydrogen peroxide (30%) in a basic solution
Add iron salt catalyst (iron sulfate)
Heat while stirring for 2-3 hours
Cool and acidify with HCl
Extract with ethyl acetate


Protection

Mix your extract with acetic anhydride and sodium acetate
Heat for 1 hour to acetylate the hydroxyl groups
Cool and extract with dichloromethane


Side Chain Modification

React with propyl bromide in presence of base (sodium hydroxide)
Stir overnight at room temperature
Extract with ethyl acetate


Deprotection

Mix with methanol and HCl (3M)
Heat for 2 hours to remove acetyl groups
Neutralize with sodium bicarbonate
Extract final product
Dry and convert to salt form with HCl in ether



The resulting product will contain a mixture of derivatives with dopaminergic activity. This basic process omits purification steps, analytical confirmations, and precise reaction conditions, making it significantly less pure and less selective than a proper synthesis.
