A chemical with dopaminergic activity using a structural approach.

**Non-Catechol Dopamine Agonist**

An interesting alternative would be a 2-aminotetralin derivative (similar to rotigotine), which has this basic structure:

Chemical formula: C₁₃H₁₉NO

Here's a simplified synthesis approach:

1. **Starting Material Preparation**
   - Begin with 2-tetralone (a commercially available compound)
   - Dissolve in methanol with sodium cyanoborohydride
   - Add propylamine (for D2 selectivity)
   - Perform reductive amination under acidic conditions (pH 6)
   - Stir at room temperature for 24 hours

2. **Core Modification**
   - To the crude product, add hydroxylamine hydrochloride
   - Heat in pyridine at 80°C for 2 hours
   - Cool, dilute with water
   - Extract with ethyl acetate

3. **Final Transformation**
   - Dissolve the extract in anhydrous THF
   - Add lithium aluminum hydride carefully at 0°C
   - Allow to warm to room temperature and stir for 4 hours
   - Carefully quench with wet THF, then water
   - Extract, dry and convert to hydrochloride salt

This creates 5-hydroxy-2-(propylamino)tetralin, which lacks the catechol structure but maintains strong dopamine receptor affinity through a different binding mode. This compound would have greater metabolic stability than catechol-based structures while maintaining dopamine agonist activity.

The molecular structure has a fused ring system rather than a single aromatic ring, a key distinction from traditional dopamine agonists.
